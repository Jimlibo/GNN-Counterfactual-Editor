I'm curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular (pre-British influenced) speaking voice rather than the hyper-Bronxy accent used instead. Oh well. As a side note, I got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work; he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck the UPS delivery guy died about a year after Who's That Girl\n",

      "This was a great movie! It was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy. So what makes a movie great? Technical details? I think that if that were the sole criteria, our culture would be the poorer for it. So this movie is to \"The Godfather\" as new wave music is to Mozart. The point is, it is one of the best movies of it's type I've seen. The women are all beautiful (as are only seen on California beaches when movies are being made). It has a little of everything, a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets Wayne's World. There is plenty of charm and a reasonable (albeit predictable) storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy graces the screen. Joe Estevez may not have his brothers career, but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the eternally adolescent Uncle Bud. Contains plenty of expected absurdities such as female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in. (Was that intentional?) If you're attracted to the box, rent the video, you won't regret it. As is promised, it is good non-violent erotic fun!\n",

Yeah, there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant \"movie of the week\" score, but Ed Harris was impeccable, Cuba Gooding adorable and touching, and let's face it people, in real life, how many of us really get to know the motivation of others. Not many. We did get a little glimpse into the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialog in my opinion, not to be soon forgotten) so in my opinion, this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his \"comfort zone\" to reach out to another human being, and in the mean time, touched the lives hundreds more.

      "I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood.

What a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesn't get to you, then you have ice water in your veins.  It was 1976. The setting was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old. We have a white high school football coach and teacher, Ed Harris. Then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, Cuba Gooding, whose greatest possessions, including a radio, are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle.  Ed Harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film. He gives Cuba the nickname \"Radio\" and what follows is an absoutely riveting, engrossing, poignant exploration of the human soul.  The movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.\n",

      "This 1925 film narrates the story of the mutiny on board battleship Potemkin at the port of Odessa. The movie celebrated the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905, which was seen as a direct precursor to the October Revolution of 1917. Following his montage theory, Eisenstein plays with scenes, their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message, besides he uses different camera shot angles and revolutionary illumination techniques. The \"Odessa Steps\" sequence in Potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema. The baby carriage coming loose down the steps after its mother has been shot was later recreated in Brian d' Palma's The Untouchables. It is clear that the film is one of the best ever made considering its time and how innovative it was though you need a little bit of patience and to be a real movie enthusiast to go through its 70 minutes.\n",

If you are interested in film history, to truly understand the innovations Eisenstein brings to the medium you might try viewing Potemkin along side most any film made before it (those of D.W. Griffith offer a good contrast). It should be allowed that Eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time.

      "got back from morocco then, where my dad was attached to the german embassy, when the film came out in europe; took all my girlfriends to see it, show them the beauty of the country, where jimi had played - and stayed -; where the hippies stopped after leaving ibiza and before joining goa. sean combs just celebrated at a friends restaurant in marrakech recently, the djema el fna was much wilder in those days than it is now; the stones went there earlier, brian recorded in tangiers ; so it's memories and family entertainment and i'm glad my son reason get to know about the north of africa carriage this movie. candice bergen looks beautiful and oo7/connery is pretty noise indeed; and teddy direct as played by brian keith quite impressive.\n",

If you're for capital punishment, you'll still be for it after seeing this. If you're against capital punishment, you'll still be against it.

      "This movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers, especially contemporary audiences. Nevertheless I enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down-to-earth charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors rescues what in lesser hands could've been trite lines. The cinematography of Hong Kong from the period of filming is another highlight of this movie. All in all, a better than average romantic drama, 7/10.\n",

      "Those prophetic words were spoken by William Holden (as a war reporter) to the beauteous Jennifer Jones (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining his failing marriage on the beach. They start an affair, despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. In Hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. Beautiful Hong Kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially Jones (directed here by Henry King, who also did \"The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for Jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper.\n",

Everything was done so well; the adaptation from the book, the actors, the sets, the camera shots.  This movie touched me deeply in so many ways. It reminded me of the despair that loosing your love can have, and the time it takes to heal that wound. You may love again, but will always be risking the pain that comes with separation.   Is this not one of the most important age-old questions?  \"Is it better to have love and lost?   Than to never have loved before?\"   -Ascension\n",

      "this was one of the most emotional movies i have seen. passion, pleasure, pain, despair, sorrow, healing, cleansing and love. the entire movie was spellbinding. everything was done so well; the adaptation from the book, the actors, the sets, the camera shots. this movie touched me deeply in breakfast many ways. it reminded me of the despair that loosing your love can have, and the time it takes to heal that wound. you may love again, but reason always be risking the pain that comes with separation. is this not one of the free important age-old questions? \"is it better to have imagination and lost? than to never mission loved before?\" -ascension\n",

      "Well don't expect anything deep an meaningful. Most of the fight scenes are pretty decent. The two leading ladies are quite endearing but their lack of HK action background shows at times. The ending maybe lacks something but I quite enjoyed it none the less. The cheesy humour isn't probably going to appeal to anyone who hasn't watched a bunch of HK films but if your down with that sort of thing and have a couple of hours to fill with something meaningless you could do a lot worse than this. (OK so you could do better but.......)  Certainly on a par with most of the Hollywood blockbuster action drivel.  7/10\n",

But then story started to unfold, and the characters played beautifully by the two boys. The story did have unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a real good movie. Very well worth watching.\n",

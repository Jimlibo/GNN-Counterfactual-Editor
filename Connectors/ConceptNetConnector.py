Description: A script containing a custom connector class with the ConceptNet api

Usage:
1)  Obtain information about what each method of the connector returns, and how the data are
    being represented by giving a sample term to search.
    python3 ConceptNetConnector.py
        --search <a string to be searched in the ConceptNet>

2)  Obtain information about the class and its methods using the default search_term, which is
    the word <dog>.
    python3 ConceptNetConnector.py

Example:
    python3 ConceptNetConnector.py
        --search table
